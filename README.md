## 🚀 Project Overview

**MUL** is a complete **city-to-city and local ride booking platform**, designed and developed to offer a reliable transportation system for regional passengers, drivers, and fleet vendors.

The system connects customers, drivers (captains), and vendors through a unified management portal for:
- Vehicle onboarding
- Ride allocation
- Vendor–captain earnings split
- Complaint resolution
- Fare & payment management

This platform was **designed, built, and operated entirely by Waheed Shah** in Pakistan.  
The project reached operational stage but paused due to funding constraints — the system remains ready for reactivation and scaling.
